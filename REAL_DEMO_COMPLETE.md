✅ **Real Responses** - Actual Neo4j query results displayed  
✅ **Technical Voiceover** - Explains architecture, technology stack, and purpose  
✅ **Perfect Sync** - 353.85s duration matches voiceover exactly  

### 🎙️ Voiceover Content - Technical Explanation

The voiceover explains in detail:

1. **What We Built**
   - Intelligent conversational interface for healthcare data analytics
   - Integration of Neo4j, LangChain, and Streamlit
   - Purpose: Democratize access to healthcare data

2. **How It Works**
   - Three-layer architecture (UI → LangChain → Neo4j)
   - Graph database vs traditional relational databases
   - Node and relationship structure (hospitals, patients, physicians, visits, payers, reviews)
   - Natural language to Cypher query conversion

3. **Technology Deep Dive**
   - **Neo4j Graph Database**: Stores healthcare data as interconnected nodes
   - **LangChain**: Processes natural language, generates Cypher queries
   - **Streamlit**: Provides clean, intuitive chat interface
   - **Docker**: Containerized deployment

4. **Why Graph Databases for Healthcare**
   - Medical data is inherently interconnected
   - Multi-hop relationship queries (patient → visit → physician → hospital)
   - Efficient traversals vs SQL joins
   - Temporal relationship tracking

5. **Query Types Demonstrated**
   - Simple lookups: "Show me all hospitals in California"
   - Aggregations: "What are the hospital statistics?"
   - Relationship traversal: "Which patients were treated by Dr. Sarah Johnson?"
   - Temporal queries: "Show visit history for John Smith"
   - Analytics: "Most common diagnoses"
   - Financial: "Which physicians have the highest salaries?"
   - Qualitative: "Show me patient reviews"

6. **Technical Implementation**
   - Streamlit session state for conversation history
   - LangChain's graph chain for query generation
   - Neo4j bolt protocol for database communication
   - Containerized stack with Docker

### 📝 Script Excerpt

*"What we built is an intelligent conversational interface for healthcare data analytics. This isn't just a simple Q&A bot. It's a sophisticated system that combines three powerful technologies: Neo4j graph database, LangChain AI framework, and Streamlit for the user interface..."*

*"Neo4j is a graph database, not a traditional relational database. Instead of tables and rows, it stores data as nodes and relationships... The graph structure is perfect for healthcare because medical data is inherently interconnected..."*

*"LangChain is the middleware that makes natural language work. When you type a question, LangChain uses a large language model to understand your intent, identifies the relevant entities and relationships, and generates a Cypher query..."*
