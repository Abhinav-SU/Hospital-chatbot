Welcome to the Hospital Chatbot - an intelligent healthcare data analytics system built with Neo4j, LangChain, and Streamlit.

This system demonstrates the power of graph databases for healthcare. Unlike traditional relational databases, Neo4j stores data as connected nodes and relationships, making it perfect for medical data where everything is interconnected.

The architecture is simple but powerful. Streamlit provides the user interface. LangChain converts your natural language questions into Cypher database queries. And Neo4j executes those queries against our healthcare graph.

Let me show you what it can do. First, we'll query hospitals in California. The chatbot understands the question, generates a Cypher query, and returns the results instantly.

Next, hospital statistics. The system aggregates data across multiple nodes, showing visit counts for each hospital.

We can explore relationships too. This query finds all patients treated by a specific physician, demonstrating how graph databases excel at relationship traversal.

Patient histories show the temporal dimension. Each visit connects to a physician, hospital, diagnosis, and insurance payer, creating a rich medical timeline.

The system handles analytics queries like most common diagnoses, helping administrators identify health trends and allocate resources effectively.

Financial queries mix clinical and operational data. This integrated view is crucial for healthcare management.

Finally, patient reviews provide qualitative feedback, helping hospitals improve satisfaction.

The power of this system is its flexibility. Unlike rigid dashboards, you can ask novel questions and get answers, as long as the data exists in the graph.

This is the future of healthcare data interaction - making complex analytics accessible through simple conversation. Thank you for watching.
